while studying MCA, i had a friend who was not used to study but used to get marks better than people who studied..
I was always confused how he did it!!
one fine day i got to know that while listening to lecturers he used to focus.
In addition to this, he also teaches other students. He listens to the lecturers in college and in the evening, he teaches it to student who did not understand. This helped remeber what he had listened in the class.
How did he manage to concentrate in class when everybody were not. May be it was his style of learning things. But i was sure he used to focus litrally like laser sharp..
I am one such student who never listens in class nor when when my friend teaches, i am very much into sports, i play like 5-6 hrs per day.
